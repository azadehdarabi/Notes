**MongoDB Atlas** is [MongoDB’s fully-managed cloud database service](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/). The service is built to handle enterprise workloads, with support for global [clusters](https://studio3t.com/academy/lessons/introduction-to-mongodb-atlas/#cluster).

You can store your data with **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, **Google Cloud Platform**, or **Microsoft Azure**. However, you don’t need to set up an account with any of these platforms. MongoDB Atlas takes care of all this behind the scenes.

MongoDB Atlas also automatically handles backend administrative processes such as provisioning resources, setting up clusters, or scaling services. Most of the tasks you perform are simple point-and-click operations that you carry out through the service’s centralized web interface.
