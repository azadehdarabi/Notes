The `Q` object is a powerful tool in Django for constructing complex queries using logical operators. It allows you to build queries that use logical AND, OR, and NOT operators to combine multiple query conditions together.

For example, suppose you have a Person model with fields first_name, last_name, and age, and you want to construct a query that returns all people with a first name of "John" and an age of 30 or older. You could use the Q object to construct the query like this:


```python
from django.db.models import Q

q = Q(first_name='John') & Q(age__gte=30)
people = Person.objects.filter(q)
```

In this example, we construct two `Q` objects representing the query conditions for the first name and last name, respectively. We then combine the two `Q` objects using the `|` operator to create a single `Q` object representing the logical OR of the two conditions.
